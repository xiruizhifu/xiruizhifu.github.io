However, the risk of this type of investment is definitely higher than T-bills, T-notes and T-bonds, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to address the default risk for this business. In this story, we explored many aspects for personal loan business based on the Prosper Loan Dataset, including the default rates across different states of US, sereval factors which have clear impact on default rate, etc. Moreover, this analysis showed that higher risk loans don\u0026rsquo;t guarantee higher return so a useful tip for investors was given.\nPersonal Loan Business over Time Since 2009, the online personal loan business has increased steadily and climbed up quickly since 2013 and then droped down at the beginning of 2014. However, the borrower credit score has went down over time.\nDefault Rates across US Default rates for different states of US have obvious variance, and the default rate in some states were higher than 30%.\nRelevant Factors about the Default Rate Higher Income, Lower BorrowerRate and Better Credit Rating imply Lower Default Rate. An interesting pattern was found among the college student group which shows that higher grade students would have more loans and lower default rate, with exception for sophomore student.\nHigher Return, Higher Risk It\u0026rsquo;s clearly that ProsperRating is a good indicator and the general principle is: higher return means higher risk. However, loans with rating HR have the highest risk but don\u0026rsquo;t have the highest estimated return and loans with C\u0026amp;D have higher actual principal loss than E\u0026amp;HR. So don\u0026rsquo;t put your money in C\u0026amp;D loans.\nFinal Story You can found the online version of this story Here.\nAdditional Information Design of the First Version The prosper dataset is a complex dataset which contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables, so before I began to create the visualisation, I asked one question to myself again and agian:\n What do I want to learn from this dataset?  My answer was: The most important things that I cared about for this dataset are the status and the relevant factors about the default rate. So the story about this dataset was focus on the default rate and I divided them into three groups:\n Trends of the loans over time and the spatial distribution of the default rate; The relationships between the default rate and the relevant factors; Interesting patterns and useful insights that were found in this process.  Group One\n Trends of the loans over time: Line Chart; Trends of the ProsperScore over time: Line Chart; Spatial distribution of the default rate: Thematic Maps.  In order to see whether each state had the similar tread or not, I chose to use different colors to stand for different state. Also, I created an action to connect the trends of the loans and the default rate map.\nGroup Two\nI found three obvious relevant factors of the default rate, so I made three visualisations to show the relatioships between them:\n Default rate \u0026amp; IncomeRange: Bar Chart; Default rate \u0026amp; ProsperRating: Stacked Bar Chart, with one bar for each ProsperRating and using color to stand for each IncomeRange within that ProsperRating loans; Default rate \u0026amp; BorrowerRate: Scatter Plot, with using color to stand for each Occupation, and I added a filter for different ProsperRating. Also, I found an interesting patter about the college student group, so I created a group named \u0026ldquo;College Student\u0026rdquo;, and then used \u0026ldquo;size\u0026rdquo; to encode this new group variable to make the \u0026ldquo;College Student\u0026rdquo; standing out.  For the interesting patter about the \u0026ldquo;College Student\u0026rdquo; group, I created a new chart to show the loans number and default rate among them:\n Default rate of the College Student: I used two Bar Charts to show the loans number and defualt rate for different grade of the college students. And I used the \u0026ldquo;red color\u0026rdquo; to draw attention for the \u0026ldquo;Sophomore\u0026rdquo; student.  Group Three\nBased on the analysis I found that ProsperRating is a good indicator for the default risk of the loans, so I created four bar charts to show EstimatedEffectiveYield, EstimatedLoss, EstimatedReturn, and the Actual Net Principal Loss for loans of different rating. Also, I used \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo; to draw attention for the \u0026ldquo;HR\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; loans.\nFinally, I came up a 3-steps story as follows:\n Demonstrate the trends and status of the Loans using time series line plot and thematic map; Explore the relationships between the default rate and its relevant factors; Emphasise that higher return means higher risk, and tell the audience don\u0026rsquo;t put money in C\u0026amp;D loans based on this dataset.  Changes after Feedback I sent my story to a friend and the response was that it looks like a mess. Well, so sad.\nThe main point was that I put too many charts in just one screen, and the elements were not rendered clearly in the laptop screen, which would make people stop reading this story entirely.\nUpon hearing this feedback I realized that I didn\u0026rsquo;t take different screen sizes of various kinds of the devices today into consideration. I just chose the automatic layout and tweak them to look pretty on my own laptop which has a very high resolution.\nTherefore, I divided the 3-steps story into a 5-steps story, and the important changes were:\n In the step 1 of the original story, I created a line chart of the loans number as well as the loans amount, and the trends of them were quite similar, so I removed the line chart of the loans number because the loans amount is more imoortant than the loan number. After the removal of one line chart, it looks more clearly and tidy; In the step 2 of the original story, I put all the relevant factors into one place, which made it a messy and different to understand, so I divided the step 2 of the original story into 3 pieces and ordered them in a way which is easy to follow; In the step 3 of the original story, I created four bar charts to show EstimatedEffectiveYield, EstimatedLoss, EstimatedReturn, and the Actual Net Principal Loss for loans of different rating. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to put all of the EstimatedEffectiveYield, EstimatedLoss, EstimatedReturn together, only the EstimatedLoss and EstimatedReturn would be enough, so I removed the EstimatedEffectiveYield bar chart; Besides, I realized that the caption boxes of the original story occupied some place, but there were some unused space in the charts themselves. What is more, widescreen is very common now so the vertical space is really precious. As a result, I decided to change the navagator style from \u0026ldquo;Caption boxes\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Numbers\u0026rdquo;, and rewrote the most important information of the \u0026ldquo;Caption boxes\u0026rdquo; then added them as \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; in or under the blank space of the charts.  Finally, I modified the original 3-steps story into a 5-steps story and changed the navagator style from \u0026ldquo;Caption boxes\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Numbers\u0026rdquo;.\nResources  Tableau Online Help  ",

    "summary": "A super-resolution method based on sparse representation and classified texture patches wasproposed,mainly using the priori knowledge and texture to reconstruct remote sensing images.First,extract image blocks for dictionary learning,the over-complete dictionary was learned from the highand low resolution remote sensing image blocks.Orthogonal match pursuit was used to calculate thesparse conefficients,then the coefficients were fixed,iterative method was used to update the diction-ary until the algorithm converges.Then,the training dictionary was used to reconstruct the remotesensing images.In this step,the image was divided into smooth patches and non-smooth patches,bicubic interpolation was used for smooth patches while sparse conefficients and over-complete diction-ary were used for non-smooth patches.Experiment shows that this method has a faster reconstructionspeed and can achieve satisfied super-resolution results in the visual effects and objective evaluation in-dicators.",

    "summary": "This article presents an urban heat island retrieval and analysis method with HJ-1B satellite imagery. The study area is Beijing, one of the largest cities in the world, which has experienced a rapid urban expansion over the last two decades. Accelerated urbanization has created serious impacts on its thermal environment. Retrieval and quantitative analysis of UHI patterns in Beijing is significant to understand the worsening urban climate problem in the area. More than 200 HJ-1B images of the study area were acquired and analyzed. Then 48 least-clouded scenes were selected to generate LST maps. The digital number (DN) values of the HJ-1B TIR band were converted from their recorded DN to spectral radiance. In order to perform the extraction, temperature images are created by masking out all areas of clouds and open water. To eliminate atmospheric interference on HJ-1B images, atmospheric correction of the red and near infrared reflectance band of HJ-1 image was carried out using ENVI FLAASH atmospheric correction module. The wavelength of the TIR band of HJ-1B is similar to the thermal band of TM5, and the spectral response curves of the two TIR bands matched well. Because HJ-1B has only one suitable thermal band to retrieval LST, so we adopted single-channel algorithm to retrieve LST from TIR band of the HJ-1B satellite. Land surface emissivity (ε) can effectively transmit thermal energy across the surface into the atmosphere, which was obtained through the NDVI thresholds method. A 2.5-dimensional Gaussian surface approximation was modeled to quantitatively describe the location, shape and size of the heat island, and to describe the urban heat environment and its seasonal variation. The algorithmic procedure for UHI analysis was performed in IDL (Interactive Data Language). The input data of UHI extraction were the HJ-1B LST imagery, as described above. The average suburban LST plus a threshold value (1℃) were regarded as potential heat island pixels. It was found that the daytime UHI demonstrated distinctive seasonal variation, with the maximum during summer and the minimum during winter. A series of 2.5-D model were created to analyze the UHI and its seasonal variation. Through monitoring and analyzing the UHI effect, the results illustrated that the spread of the UHI in Beijing extended for 33.92 km in longitude direction, 40.92 km in latitude direction and 1 090.14 km2 in footprint area in summer, respectively. The urban area surface temperature was lower than the rural area temperature in winter, which has become an urban cooling island. On the basis of the accurately retrieval and analysis of Beijing UHI with HJ-1B satellite imagery, it was concluded that the HJ-1B TIR image is an ideal source for UHI study.",
