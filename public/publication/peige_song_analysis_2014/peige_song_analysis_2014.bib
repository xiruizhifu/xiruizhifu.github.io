 abstract = {Objective To evaluate the quality of Chinese child health care status and the dissimilarity among different regions, and provide reference for child health care planning and policy-making. Methods Based on six basic child health indicators (the rate of birth weight \textless2 500 g, perinatal mortality, the proportion of severe malnutrition in children under 5, neonatal visit rate, system management rate of children under 3, system management rate of children under 7), TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the integrated child health care quality, the regional dissimilarity was explored by using index of dissimilarity. Results According to the Results of TOPSIS, the top three were Shanghai (C=0.783 5), Guangdong (C=0.490 3) and Beijing (0.435 0), the last three were Hunan (C=0.063 1), Shaanxi (C=0.051 8) and Fujian (C=0.029 2);Nationwide, index of dissimilarity (ID) of TOPSIS method was large(0.35).ID of the proportion of severe malnutrition in children under 5 was the largest (0.59);IDs of the rate of birth weight \textless2 500 g, system management rate of children under 3 and system management rate of children under 7 were equal (0.30);The smallest ID was perinatal mortality (0.25). Conclusion The child health care quality unevenly distributes across the country, and the policy maker should develop appropriate solutions to different indicators.},
