abstract: Objective To evaluate the quality of Chinese child health care status and
  the dissimilarity among different regions, and provide reference for child health
  care planning and policy-making. Methods Based on six basic child health indicators
  (the rate of birth weight textless2 500 g, perinatal mortality, the proportion of
  severe malnutrition in children under 5, neonatal visit rate, system management
  rate of children under 3, system management rate of children under 7), TOPSIS method
  was used to evaluate the integrated child health care quality, the regional dissimilarity
  was explored by using index of dissimilarity. Results According to the Results of
  TOPSIS, the top three were Shanghai (C=0.783 5), Guangdong (C=0.490 3) and Beijing
  (0.435 0), the last three were Hunan (C=0.063 1), Shaanxi (C=0.051 8) and Fujian
  (C=0.029 2);Nationwide, index of dissimilarity (ID) of TOPSIS method was large(0.35).ID
  of the proportion of severe malnutrition in children under 5 was the largest (0.59);IDs
  of the rate of birth weight textless2 500 g, system management rate of children
  under 3 and system management rate of children under 7 were equal (0.30);The smallest
  ID was perinatal mortality (0.25). Conclusion The child health care quality unevenly
  distributes across the country, and the policy maker should develop appropriate
  solutions to different indicators.
